This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The was my first major project that I built in React. 

It was a huge learning expoerience for me. It began as an app that you enter the url of a face into and it displays a blue box around the face.

I later, after learning the basics of Node and Express built the back end of the application. It now includes a sign-in/ register feature displayingn the users name and for every face they detect their rank goes up.
